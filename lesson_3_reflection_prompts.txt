When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to share things with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    to have control over my local changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - copy of git hub repository. when i want someones code as my base without touching it
    clone - clone repository locally or from github. working on same thing from different places
    branch - version of same repository from some point. can be merged after. for bugs/features of the same project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    easier to see the local changes and fast merge

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    emails, phone, diff files
    merging is harder.
    keeping track easier

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    master - no merging
    new branch - cleaner and allows testing without stumbling on other changes
